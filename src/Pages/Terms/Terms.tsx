                        2. When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘AliThemes’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.

                        about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each product makes them
                        separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.
